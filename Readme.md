# Deep Image Model Zoo
This repository shows how to build several image models from scratch using **tf.keras** including VGG, ResNet, MobileNet v1, MobileNet v2, Xception and DenseNet (and more in the near future).

All examples are written in clean, simple and structured fashion. I believe even if you are new to these models can easily understand the source codes.

In addition, the API is designed to be flexible to different datasets and model complexity is also controllable. Each model also comes with clear documentation to help you set up models you found in their original paper. 

Hopefully the examples can help you quickly access modern image models in minutes. Enjoy it!
