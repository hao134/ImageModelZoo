# Deep Image Model Zoo
This repository shows how to build several image models from scratch using **tf.keras** including VGG, ResNet, MobileNet v1, MobileNet v2 and DenseNet (and more in the near future).

All examples are written in clean, simple, structured, and elegant fashion as much as possible. I believe even if you are new to these models can easily understand the source codes.

In addition, the API is designed to be flexible to different datasets and model complexity with clear documentation. 

Hopefully the examples can help you quickly access modern image models in minutes. Enjoy it.
